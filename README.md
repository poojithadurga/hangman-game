# hangman-game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess the word by suggesting letters. The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses (6 attempts) before the hangman is complete and the game is over. The game features a clean and intuitive interface, with input validation to ensure the player enters valid guesses. After each round, the player is asked if they want to play again, allowing for multiple rounds of fun. This code is well-structured and easy to understand, making it a great example of a beginner-friendly project.
